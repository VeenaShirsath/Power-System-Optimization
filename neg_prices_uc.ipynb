    "# Negative Prices in Linearized Unit Commitment\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how negative electricity prices can be reproduced with a linearized unit commitment (UC) model. Such prices appear in real markets when generators with start-up costs and minimum generation limits find it more economical to offer electricity at a negative price (effectively paying to stay online) rather than shutting down and restarting later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real World context\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative prices are a recurring feature of modern electricity markets. For example, such a situation occurred in Germany (e.g., Week 15 of 2025), when high renewable output combined with limited flexibility in conventional generation pushed spot prices below zero. This typically happens when:\n",
    "* Wind and solar generation produce more power than demand in a given period\n",
    "* Conventional generators, facing high start-up and shut-down costs, prefer to remain online even at negative prices \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we use PyPSA’s linearized unit commitment formulation to model and explore these dynamics in a simplified system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We model a single-bus system with two generators: one base-load and one peak-load, and a variable load over five time steps. The base-load unit has low marginal costs but high start-up costs and limited flexibility, while the peak unit is smaller, more expensive, and more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows negative prices to emerge during low-demand periods due to the trade-off between cycling costs and operating at minimum load.\n",
